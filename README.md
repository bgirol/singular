## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/bgirol/singular/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

          Valuable informations concerning  the Experimental estimation of errors can be found in \cite[Chapter~8, p.~157]{Farrell.2000}. It is a known fact, that numerical methods for computing approximate solutions of partial differential equations are usually applied to problems with unknown exact solution. Now, $ u $ shall be the exact solution of any given problem, $ U^N  $ shall be a numerical approximation on the mesh $ \Omega^N $, $ N $ being the number of mesh points in each coordinate direction of the discrete problem associated with the numerical
method. The canonic criterion for judging the quality of a numerical method for solving problems in the case of non-singularly perturbed
